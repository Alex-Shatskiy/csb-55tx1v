          <h2>What is HIC?</h2>
          <p>
            HCI is Human Computer interaction. It is research of design and use
            of computer technology. HCI focused on the interfaces between users
            and computers. In an HCI process you would observe the ways in which
            humans interact with computers and design technologies. This is done
            so designers of a website, application or really any kind of
            software that runs on a computer can be created and improve on the
            ways their user interact with their website, application or
            software. In what follows is a list of tasks that could be involved
            in a lifecycle of a product, which was later turn into a visual
            representation of the lifecycle

        <h2>Gathering Information</h2>
        <p>
          This is the process of gathering information around the product that
          you are designing. This form of information can be topical
          information, design information on how other parts of the internet is
          displaying a similar design, user information that works better and
          what doesnâ€™t
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="scallop-down"></div>
      <div class="card two">
        <h2>Planning</h2>
        <p>
          The planning stage is next this is where you start to use the
          information that you have gathered, and it is time to start making
          basic wire frames, vetting information, picking design choices, going
          off user needs and resources that would be needed before even
          attempting designing the project
        </p>

      <div class="card three">
        <h2>Designing</h2>
        <p>
          The design stage is starting to make more details planned where you
          start putting the building blocks, expanding the wireframe to add more
          detail. This is where the design is starting to look like what you
          want the final product to look like
        </p>

      <div class="scallop-down"></div>
      <div class="card four">
        <h2>Prototyping</h2>
        <p>
          Prototyping is where you start to take the design of the product and
          start to create what is a functional product that users can interact
          with
        </p>

      <div class="scallop-up"></div>
      <div class="card five">
        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <p>
          Testing is the final step before showing the end user the product that
          they have requested, testing will iron out anything that is broken or
          might need to be changed last minute, to make a more fluid and
          polished product.

      <div class="scallop-down"></div>
      <div class="card six">
        <h2>Feedback</h2>
        <p>
          Feedback is where you show the final designed product to the end user
          and get feedback, or any changes that might need to be done, if
          anything that needs to be done would ideally need to be researched and
          re-planned and re designed
