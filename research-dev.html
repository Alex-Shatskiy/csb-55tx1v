          We use journaling, to imporove our processes and keep a file of our
          processes during the development phase. Our research consists of groud
          sourcing, questionaires & so much more

          <h2>How do we do our research?</h2>
          <p>
            Designing and implementing a successful, revenue-generating website
            involves a lot more than just coding knowledge. While coding is the
            vital element of any web project (without it websites would not even
            exist), we want to highlight some of the periphery functions of web
            design that market research plays an important role in. These
            stages, not typically recognised as part of a design process, but
            they have help align us with customer needs and create a better
            customer experience.

        <div class="research">
          <h2>Customer Journey Development</h2>
          <p>
            First and foremost, before any aspect of the design process is
            undertaken, the expected and ideal customer journeys must be mapped.
            To do this, there are two parties that should have input: the client
            and the customers. The client will have an idea of how the customer
            should interact with the website, what marketing and sales materials
            they want them to see and in what order. This might even go as far
            to include interstitials and pop-up adverts.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="research one">
          <h2>Co-creation & Innovation</h2>
          <p>
            Developing an ideal journey is one thing, but taking it a step
            further involves inviting customers to co-create the website with
            you. Obviously most customers won’t have the expertise (or time) to
            actually develop the site – and even if they did, it is not
            advisable. Instead, this stage involves asking customers to
            contribute their innovative ideas that would make the site stand
            out.

        <div style="margin-bottom: 3%;" class="research two">
          <h2>User Experience Feedback</h2>
          <p>
            As we near the end of the development cycle and head steadily
            towards launch, we must not forget to collect usability feedback
            from our customers. No matter how similar the site to the initial
            wireframe, there will no doubt be differences that alter the
            experience and usability slightly. From load times, to the
            aesthetics and navigation of the website, our customers will always
            be more critical of the finished product than ourselfs.
